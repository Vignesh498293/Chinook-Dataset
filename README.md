**🎵 Chinook Performing Artist SQL Project**

This project explores the Chinook Music Database by performing a series of SQL queries focused on artists, albums, tracks, and sales performance. The goal of this project is to analyze the music catalog, understand artist productivity, track distribution, and evaluate revenue generated by different artists. Each SQL task demonstrates essential database skills including filtering, sorting, grouping, aggregating, joining tables, and deriving insights from relational data.

**📌 Project Overview**

The Chinook database contains information about artists, albums, tracks, customers, invoices, and more. This project focuses mainly on the Artist, Album, Track, Genre, and InvoiceLine tables. Using SQL, the project answers key analytical questions such as:

Listing artists and filtering names

Finding artists with the longest names

Counting total artists

Identifying artists without albums

Ranking artists by number of albums or tracks

Finding the artist with the most revenue

Listing customers who bought music from specific artists

This project also includes queries that connect multiple tables to reveal deeper insights, such as determining which artist generated the highest revenue or which customers bought songs from bands like Metallica or Led Zeppelin.

**🛠️ Skills Demonstrated**

SQL SELECT statements

Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG)

Pattern matching with LIKE

ORDER BY and LIMIT

Joins: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN

Grouping and filtering (GROUP BY, HAVING)

Multi-table analysis for sales insights
